In rural and underserved areas, clean drinking water is a major challenge. Distributing water filters offers a sustainable solution that eliminates the need for boiling water, reducing firewood use, indoor air pollution, and carbon emissions. This shift benefits household health—especially for women and children—and cuts greenhouse gas output.

Filters also lower the risk of waterborne diseases, reducing healthcare costs and improving productivity. Regular monitoring ensures filters are used and maintained properly, with follow-ups for repair or re-education when needed. Households are selected based on vulnerability, with rural farmers often prioritized due to their reliance on local water sources.

Water filters thus deliver both environmental and public health gains.
