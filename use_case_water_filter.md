## Use Case: Water Filter Deployment

- "filter" → `intervention_type = water_filter`
- "given out" or "delivered" → `activity_type = distribution`
- "not used in 2 weeks" → `usage_status = inactive`, `duration_days = 14`
- "broken filter" → `intervention_status = needs_replacement`
- "farmer" → `household`
